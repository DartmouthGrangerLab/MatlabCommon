    These results show the performance of the GPU or host PC when calculating the 
    <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/fft.html">Fast-Fourier-Transform</a> 
    of a vector of complex numbers. The number of operations for a vector
    of length <code>N</code> is assumed to be <code>5*N*log2(N)</code>.

    This calculation is usually memory-bound, i.e. the performance depends mainly
    on how fast the GPU or host PC can read and write data.
