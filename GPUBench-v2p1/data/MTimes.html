    These results show the performance of the GPU or host PC when calculating a 
    <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/mtimes.html">matrix multiplication</a> 
    of two NxN real matrices. The number of operations is assumed to be
    <code>2*N^3 - N^2</code>.

<p>
    This calculation is usually compute-bound, i.e. the performance depends mainly
    on how fast the GPU or host PC can perform floating-point operations.
