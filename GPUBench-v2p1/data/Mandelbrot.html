    These results show the performance of the GPU or host PC calculating elements of
    the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/demos.html?file=/products/demos/shipping/distcomp/paralleldemo_gpu_mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot Set</a>.
    The elements form a square grid with <code>(-2 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.5)</code> and 
    <code>(-1.25 &lt;= y &lt;= 1.25)</code>. Every iteration of a single element
    is assumed to take twelve floating point operations.

<p>
    Elements that are inside the set will iterate until the maximum number
    of iterations is reached and are usually limited by the GPU computation
    speed. Elements that quickly escape from the 2-circle take very little 
    computation and are more dependent on how fast data can be read and 
    written from/to memory. This is therefore a reasonably balanced test of
    memory bandwidth and computational power.
