% For each image in 'imgs', extract all responses.

% args:
%     imgs: a cell array of matrices, each representing an image
%     filters,filterSizes: see initGabor.m
%     c1Space,c1Scale,c1OL: see C1.m
%     linearPatches: a cell array with 1 cell/patchSize, each cell holds an patchSizeX * patchSizeY * nOrientations x nPatchesPerSize matrix
%     nPatchSizes: size(patchSizes,2) - kept only for backward compatibility
%     patchSizes: a 3 x nPatchSizes array of patch sizes 
%     Each column should hold [nRows; nCols; nOrients]
%     c1: a precomputed set of C1 responses, as output by C1.m
%     IGNOREPARTIALS: see C2.m
%     ALLS2C1PRUNE,ORIENTATIONS2C1PRUNE: see windowedPatchDistance.m
%
% returns: 
%     c2: a 1 x nPatchSizes cell array. Each cell is nPatches x nImgs array  holding C2 activations.
%     s2,c1,s1: cell arrays holding the particular s2, c1, or s1 response for each image, see C2.m, C1.m
%     bestBands: a 1 x nPatchSizes cell array. Each cell is nPatches x nImgs array, the band whence came the maximal response for each patch and image.
%     bestLocations: a 1 x nPatchSizes cell array. Each cell is nPatches x nImgs x 2 array, the (x,y) pair whence came the maximal response for each patch and image.
