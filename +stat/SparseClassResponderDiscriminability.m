    % if all bars of a discriminator's hist are > 0.5, a discriminator is more invariant than variant to it
    % this function will return NaN in such cases, but often you can set those nans to 0 (no discriminability)

    % above is same speed as below on cpu, 100x faster on gpu, verified identical
%     discriminability = zeros(1, n_discriminators, 'like', hist);

    %TODO: deal with negative histograms
    %PROBLEM: what does it mean to be <0?
    %   also, if we leave things 0-->1, we can simply use the dilated image as a feature, because we'll be able to use ORs (an unused synapse won't count against us)
