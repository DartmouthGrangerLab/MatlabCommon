%POLDECOMP  Performs the polar decomposition of a regular square matrix.
%   [R,U,V] = POLDECOMP(F) factorizes a non-singular square matrix F such
%   that F=R*U and F=V*R, where
%   U and V are symmetric, positive definite matrices and
%   R is a rotational matrix
function [R,U,V] = poldecomp (F)
    % This kind of decomposition is often used in continuum mechanics so it is
    % convenient to comment the code that way. From now, we use the matrix 
    % formalism of tensors. C is the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, 
    % F is the deformation tensor, lambda is the stretch.

    % Check input
    [m,n] = size(F);
    if m ~= n
        error('Matrix must be square.');
    end

    C = F' * F;
    [Q0,lambdasquare] = eig(C);
    lambda = sqrt(diag((lambdasquare))); % extract the components
    % Uinv is the inverse of U and is constructed with the help of Q0. Uinv is
    % produced in the same base as F not in the base of its eigenvectors.
    Uinv = repmat(1./lambda',size(F,1),1).*Q0*Q0';
    % Using the definition, R, U and V can now be calculated
    R = F * Uinv;
    U = R' * F;
    V = F * R';
