%CalinskiHarabasz cluster criterion / variance ratio criterion
%this measure uses Euclidean distance, and is best used when clusters are relatively spherical (if you care)
%higher is better, range is (0,Inf)
%This is roughly identical to the anova F-test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test)
%When Rick says do a "within vs between cluster" test, this is it. Silhouette coefficient will also suffice, and is more flexible.
%INPUTS:
%   X - NxD position of each data point
%   clustAssignments - 1D vector (N elements) cluster ID assigned to each datapoint (e.g. a value of 2 indicates a point was assigned to the centroid with mean at the second row of 'centroids')
function [ch] = ClusterEvalCalinskiHarabasz (X, clustAssignments)
    validateattributes(X, {'numeric'}, {}, 'ClusterEvalCalinskiHarabasz', 'X', 1);
    validateattributes(clustAssignments, {'numeric'}, {'vector','integer','positive'}, 'ClusterEvalCalinskiHarabasz', 'clustAssignments', 2);
    assert(size(X, 1) == numel(clustAssignments));
    assert(~any(isnan(X(:))), 'X contains NaN values. TODO: code a way to handle this');
    if numel(unique(clustAssignments)) == 1
        ch = NaN; %only one cluster has assignments!
        return;
    end
	
    [clusts,~,clustIdx] = unique(clustAssignments);
    K = numel(clusts);
    [N,D] = size(X);
    globalMean = mean(X, 1);
    
    centroids = zeros(K, D);
    Ni = zeros(K, 1); %number of points in each cluster
    sumD = zeros(K, 1); %sum of Squared Euclidean
    for i = 1:K
        members = (clustIdx == i);
        centroids(i,:) = mean(X(members,:), 1);
        Ni(i) = sum(members);
        sumD(i) = sum(pdist2(X(members,:), centroids(i,:)) .^ 2);
    end
    
    if sum(Ni>1) < 2
        ch = NaN; %only one cluster has >1 assignment
        return;
    end
    
    %% Within cluster variance

    %% Between cluster variance
	SSB = pdist2(centroids, globalMean) .^ 2;
	SSB = sum(Ni(Ni>1) .* SSB(Ni>1)); %Eli: removing 1-point clusters since their within-cluster variance is undefined
