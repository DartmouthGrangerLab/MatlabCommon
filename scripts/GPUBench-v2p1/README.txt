GPUBench
--------
This tool allows you to compare the performance of your GPU with other
GPUs. Some standard computationally intensive calculations are used to 
measure the memory and floating-point performance. The results are then 
shown in an HTML report.

Requirements
------------
This demo app requires:

* MATLAB R2016b or better (v9.1 or higher)
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* A GPU that is supported by MATLAB (see www.mathworks.com/discovery/matlab-gpu.html)


Running it
----------
From MATLAB, type "gpuBench". You can also use "gpuBenchReport" to see the
pre-stored results for other GPUs without running the benchmarks first.


Help
----
From MATLAB, type "help gpuBench" to view the help.
