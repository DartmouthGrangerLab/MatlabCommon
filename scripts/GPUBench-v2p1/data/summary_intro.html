    The table and chart below show the peak performance of various GPUs
    using the same version of MATLAB. Your results (if any) are highlighted
    in bold in the table and on the chart. All other results are from
    pre-stored data. The peak performance shown is usually achieved when 
    dealing with extremely large arrays. Typical performance in day-to-day
    use will usually be much lower.

  <p>
    Results captured using the CPUs on the host PC (i.e., without using a
    GPU) are included for comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results are shown for calculations in both single and double precision.
    For all results, higher is better.
